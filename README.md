📌 Course Overview

AF3005 – Programming for Finance is all about using Python to solve real-world financial problems. Instead of just learning programming concepts, this course focuses on applying them to finance—like analyzing stock prices, automating financial calculations, and building tools that make financial decision-making easier.

Whether you're new to coding or already comfortable with Python, this course helps bridge the gap between finance and technology. You'll work with real financial data, automate tasks that would take hours manually, and build practical applications like budget trackers, portfolio managers, and risk analysis tools.

🔹 What You’ll Learn:

✔ Python basics and financial data manipulation
✔ Working with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for financial analysis
✔ Implementing financial models and automating calculations
✔Building applications like stock trackers, budget planners, and portfolio managers
